Personal training is one-on-one instruction that incorporates exercise screening, goal-setting and health education. Following a fitness consultation, the trainer will design a challenging workout routine specifically designed for each individual’s needs. Your personal trainer is there to instruct you on proper lifting techniques, introduce you to exercises that target your specific goals and motivate you towards your full potential.

This FITNESS PROGRAM  are designed to give you an efficient workout in a fun environment. They also dictate a schedule that will help you keep exercise in your routine, as well as some measure of accountability to remain committed to the goal.
