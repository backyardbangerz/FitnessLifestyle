Incorporating elements of yoga, martial arts and other forms of exercise, this class will help to improve posture, strength and flexibility with a focus on stretching and strengthening the whole body.

## Types of Pilates

The two basic forms of Pilates are:
* Mat-based Pilates – this is a series of exercises performed on the floor using gravity and your own body weight to provide resistance. The main aim is to condition the deeper, supporting muscles of your body to improve posture, balance and coordination
* Equipment-based Pilates – this includes specific equipment that works against spring-loaded resistance, including the ‘reformer’, which is a moveable carriage that you push and pull along its tracks. Some forms of Pilates include weights (such as dumbbells) and other types of small equipment that offer resistance to the muscles.

## The benefits:

1. Improved flexibility
2. Increased muscle strength and tone, particularly of your abdominal muscles, lower back, hips and buttocks (the ‘core muscles’ of your body)
3. Balanced muscular strength on both sides of your body
4. Enhanced muscular control of your back and limbs
5. Improved stabilisation of your spine

people who have recently had surgery

* Pregnant women
* People aged 40 years or more
* People with a pre-existing medical condition such as heart disease
