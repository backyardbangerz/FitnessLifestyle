## Goals

The ultimate goal of Yoga is Moksha (liberation), although the exact form this takes depends on the philosophical or theological system with which it is conjugated. In the classical Astanga yoga system, the ultimate goal of yoga practice is to achieve the state of Samadhi and abide in that state as pure awareness.

According to Jacobsen, Yoga has five principal traditional meanings

1. a disciplined method for attaining a goal;
2. techniques of controlling the body and the mind;
3. a name of a school or system of philosophy (darśana);
4. with prefixes such as "hatha-, mantra-, and laya-, traditions specialising in particular techniques of yoga;
5. the goal of Yoga practice.
